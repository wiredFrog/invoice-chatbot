An e-commerce analytics organization aims to extract and utilize data from user purchase bills (provided in image format) for various analytical purposes.

Used langgraph react agent as the main chat agent (conversation_agent). 

How it works:
1. The user interacts with the agent by typing messages.
2. The conversation_agent receives the user's input and uses the conversation_agent_prompt and the LLM to determine the next action.
3. Based on the user's request, the agent might decide to use one of the available tools:
    - If the user provides an image URL (Assuming that the user has uploaded the image and we are directly receiving its url) or implicitly refers to an invoice, the agent might use the InvoiceExtractor tool to extract information from the image.
    - If the agent has extracted invoice data, it might use the save_invoice_data tool to save the information to a JSON file.
    - The InvoiceExtractor tool takes an image URL, reads the image (or uses a local default), converts it to Base64, and sends it along with a prompt (defined in invoice_extractor_prompt and incorporating the schema from predefined_schema.json) to the Groq LLM.
4. The Groq LLM processes the image and the prompt and returns the extracted information (likely as a JSON string).
5. The save_invoice_data tool takes this extracted JSON string and saves it to a file.
6. The agent then responds to the user based on the outcome of the tool usage or its internal reasoning.

Suggested Improvements: 
* History Management: Right now the whole history is getting passed to the agent as context, if the conversation grows this can increase cost as well as cost efficiency of the model. To tackle this we can use some techniques for managing history like summarzation or sliding window summarization etc.
* Handling Multipage Invoices: We can use the llm in loop to dynamically extract the required fields.
* Prompting: Better prompting technique to handle user nuisance.
